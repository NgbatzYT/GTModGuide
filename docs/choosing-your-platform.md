# Choosing Your Platform

Before installing mods, you need to choose the platform you will be running Gorilla Tag on. Currently, as mentioned before, modding is only supported on **PCVR**.

### Platforms

- [Windows](windows.md)  
  The most supported platform with the easiest setup and compatibility with BepInEx mods.

- [Linux](linux.md)  
  Supported via Steam and Proton. Setup may require additional configuration, but most mods can run if requirements are met.
