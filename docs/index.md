### Is modding the game safe?
while modding is not officialy supported by the developers, if you use mods and not cheats you will probably be safe.

it is important to understand the difference between Mods and Cheats

> **Mods**
> - Mods **do not** provide an advantage over other players.
> - Examples:  
>   - Custom cosmetic mods (e.g., "Gorilla Shirts")  
>   - Mod panels restricted to modded lobbies only (e.g., "Grate")  
> - These come with a low risk of getting banned if used responsibly.
>
> **Cheats**
> - Cheats **do provide** an advantage over other players.
> - Examples:  
>   - Mod menus that work in noral lobbies  
> - These come with a high risk of getting banned.

> ðŸš¨ Any reports of cheating or detection by Anti-Cheat put your account at high risk of a ban.
> ðŸš« It is rare we unban when Mods are involved.
> âœ… Mod responsibly, stick to private spaces, and use trusted sources.
