### Is modding the game safe?
While modding may not be officially supported by the developers, if you don't use cheats you have a lower chance of getting banned.

It is important to understand the difference between Mods and Cheats.

> **Mods**
> - Mods **do not** provide an advantage over other players.
> - Examples:  
>   - Custom cosmetic mods (e.g., "Gorilla Shirts", "Monke Cosmetics")
>   - QoL or CS mods (e.g., "Gorilla Info Watch", "Computer Interface")  
>   - Mod panels restricted to modded lobbies only (e.g., "Grate")  
> - These come with a low risk of getting banned if used responsibly.
>
> **Cheats**
> - Cheats **do provide** an advantage over other players.
> - Examples:  
>   - Mod menus that work in non-modded lobbies.
>   - Ban, Kick, or Tag Gun.
>   - Anything that makes the player rig not behave correctly.
>   - Player tracking. (Does not include the Friend Station)
>   - Getting all in-game cosmetics for free.
>   - Invis, and Ghost Monke.
> - These come with a high risk of getting banned.
>
> For the lowest chance of being banned we recommend only using Monke Mod Manager to install mods.

> ðŸš¨ Any reports of cheating or detection by Anti-Cheat put your account at high risk of a ban.

> âœ… Mod responsibly, stick to private spaces, and use trusted sources.
